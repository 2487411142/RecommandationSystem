# Project Website

This website demonstrates the recommendations generated by our project analysis. It provides an interactive interface for querying and viewing the results.

Additionally, the website includes various graphs that analyse our dataset. The dataset used here is the one generated after the ETL process.

## How to Run

To run the website using Docker, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you are in the current directory (`web` folder under project root folder).
2. Execute the following command:
    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```
3. Once the containers are up and running, the website will be accessible on port 80. Open your browser and visit: http://localhost/

To stop and clean up the containers, execute the following command in the current directory:
```bash
docker compose down
```

## Technology Stack

The website uses the following technologies:

- **Flask** (Backend): We chose Flask as the backend framework because it integrates easily with Spark, allowing us to efficiently access and serve data generated from the CSV files created during our analysis.
- **React** (Frontend): The frontend is built with React, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface for interacting with the data and visualizations.
